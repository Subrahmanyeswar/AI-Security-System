# üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time AI Security System  

An AI-powered real-time security system that detects **faces, objects, and unauthorized access** using **YOLOv8 + DeepFace**.  
When an intruder or unknown object is detected, the system raises an **alarm** and records video evidence automatically.

## üöÄ Features
- üîç Real-time face recognition (authorized vs unauthorized)  
- üéØ Object detection with YOLOv8  
- üìπ Automatic recording of intrusions (saved in `recordings/`)  
- üîî Instant alarm sound for alerts  
- üóÇÔ∏è Supports multiple authorized users

## Authorized Faces Setup

This project requires images of authorized persons for the face recognition system.  
‚ö†Ô∏è For privacy and security reasons, these images are **not included** in the repository.

To set it up:
1. Go to the folder: `data/authorized_faces/`
2. Create a subfolder for each authorized person (e.g., `person1`, `person2`)
3. Place 10‚Äì20 clear face images of each person in their respective folder  
   - Use `.jpg` or `.png`
   - Include multiple angles/lighting conditions

Example structure:


## ‚ö° How to Run
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Subrahmanyeswar/AI-Security-System.git
cd AI-Security-System

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the system
python main.py
